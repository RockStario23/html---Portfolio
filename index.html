    <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>A 30 year old who likes dad jokes, people,
            and has a tendency to persist till a task is
            completed or a new skill mastered. The
            establishment, development and
            maintenance of relationships with people
            feels effortless to me, and applies to not
            only clients, but suppliers, friends, and
            work colleagues as well. I find I generally
            pick up and retain concepts, processes and
            procedures fairly quickly, and enjoy a
            healthy amount of research when it comes
            to making a decision - I feel quite strongly
            about always making a well informed one.
            I am a proud father of a fluffball named
            Hugo, who helps to further develop my
            people skills as he likes other people
            more than me. He is my exercise buddy,
            and makes sure I get a good night's rest as
            his self determined bed time is 9:30pm
